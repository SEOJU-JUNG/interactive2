        <p class="p1"><strong>Hong Kong (CNN business) </strong>Samsung on Thursday announced the launch of its expensive — and troubled — Galaxy Fold, which will become the first foldable phone to hit the market.

The Fold, which opens like a book, will go on sale in South Korea on Friday. Sales in other countries, including France, Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States, will follow, though Samsung did not specify when exactly the phone will reach those markets.
 <br>
The foldable phone, which will retail for $1,980, was originally supposed to hit stores in April. Those plans were shelved after reports from early users about how quickly the device broke.
Samsung (SSNLF) said Thursday that it has spent the past several months "refining" the phone.

        </p>
        <p>
        Samsung's new phone will go head-to-head with rival smartphone maker Huawei's foldable phone. The Chinese tech company is expected to launch its $2,600 Mate X later this year. The phone was delayed so Huawei could test it further. Huawei hasn't yet revealed an official release date.
        Samsung is also dealing with problems in its memory chip business. Global demand has slowed and a dispute between Japan and South Korea threatens to restrict the supply of chemicals Samsung needs to make semiconductors.
