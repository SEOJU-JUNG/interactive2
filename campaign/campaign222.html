            The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP) is the largest of the five offshore plastic accumulation zones in the world’s oceans. The GPGP covers an estimated surface area of 1.6 million square kilometers, an area seven times the size of S.Korea. It is located between East-Asia countries and the USA, which eventually return back and harmfully impacting on us health.
          <br>To against for further damage, many countries, including China, the USA, and Japan, have been intensifying the plastic laws. Korea also should take responsibility for the issue and tighten plastic laws up to the level of other countries who have been practically implementing such laws. Otherwise, it will impact our ecosystems, health, and economies.

                   <p class="body-2 body-222">
                     In 2019, South Korea consumed 144 kg of plastic per capita, surpassing both the US and China at 99kg and 63 kg. And, more than half of the plastic waste from South Korea is composed of packaging. The overflowing plastic package coming from the delivery food is one of the biggest reasons —Daily orders for delivery apps are estimated at more than 1.5 million, using at least three disposable containers at a time.  Delivery alone providers 4.5 million plastic waste daily.  <br>According to Greenpeace's Kim, "Consumers can bear the discomfort and reduce their use of single-use cups and straws, but a greater portion of plastic production and waste is created by industry and their packaging. It's time for the industry to reduce plastic."
Undoubtedly, plastic laws should be strengthened to increase corporate responsibility for environmental pollution further and prevent the provision of disposable products for free when delivering or take out.

                   <p class="body-2">
                     Plastic debris that is less than five millimeters in length (or about the size of a sesame seed) are called microplastics. Microbeads are in a lot of stuff, but they show upmost in personal care products. — Face soap, body wash, toothpaste, etc. Companies <br>put them in these products as an exfoliant or just for texture.
                        <br>  <br>  They are so small that most of them end up in our waterways.
                  These tiny bits of plastic act like sponges,  soaking up the toxins around them. So, a single microbead can end up being a million times more toxic than the water around it, which comes back to our meal once they get eaten by fish and other animals.

S.Korea's the highest   <br>
                <span>microplastic <br>pollution level.</span>
              </h2>

        <p class="body-2">
        South Korea's ocean microplastic pollution level is almost the highest in the world.
        Researchers at the University of Manchester in the U.K reported that the Merge and Irwell rivers in the U.K have the highest microplastic concentration in the world. And, Korea's Incheon coast and Nakdong River were ranked second and third.
    "Styrofoam buoy is the main causation for the level of microplastic density on the coast of Korea,"<br>said  Dr. Hong Sun-wook, a header of the East Asian Sea Community of Ocean. "There are many fish farms in the West Sea and the South Sea in Korea, but most of the buoys used in these farms are Styrofoam," said CEO Hong Sun-wook." the foam buoys are crushed and piled up on the shore and lead to the high concentration of microplastic."
